 This short Linux-based code roughly illustrates what a potential attack means.
 It is NOT intended as a 'virus'. However, one can think of it in such a way.
 Thereby I clearly state here that I cannot assume any responsibility upon what any person can do with this code once it is public
(open-source).

 It was designed just to support the statements made in a Diploma project dealing with security over Internet.
 The project has been held at Electronics and Information Technology faculty within Politehnica University in Bucharest, in July 2015.
 The project was guided by two tutors: me and a colleague of mine from the Economics Department.

 What this code mainly does, in this order:
 - identifies the current (default) shell;
 - identifies the current logged user;
 - uses 'sed' binary (text processing tool) in order to demonstrate that it can do 'harm' over one/several file(s).

 The code doesn't actually modifies anything among the current user's personal files. It only shows that such a thing is perfectly
possible.
 The 'sed' command used here searches for a specific string that relies within the SSH keys one stores in his home folder. Once this
string is found it is replaced with another one, thus showing that a potential attack can happen anytime.
